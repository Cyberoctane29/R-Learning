# Background for this activity

In this activity, you’ll review a scenario and practice adding annotations to a data visualization with `ggplot2`. You will also learn how to save images from `ggplot2` visualizations so that you can add them directly to presentations.

## The Scenario

As a junior data analyst for a hotel booking company, you have been creating visualizations in R with the `ggplot2` package to share insights about your data with stakeholders. After creating a series of visualizations using `ggplot()`, `ggplot2` aesthetics, and filters, your stakeholder asks you to add annotations to your visualizations to help explain your findings in a presentation. Luckily, `ggplot2` has annotation functions built in.

## Step 1: Import your data

If you haven't exited out of RStudio since importing this data last time, you can skip these steps. Rerunning these code chunks won't affect your console if you want to run them just in case, though.

Run the code below to read in the file 'hotel_bookings.csv' into a data frame:

```{r}
hotel_bookings <- read.csv("/kaggle/input/hotel-bookings-main/hotel_bookings.csv")
```

## Step 2: Refresh Your Memory

By now, you are pretty familiar with this data set. But you can refresh your memory with the `head()` and `colnames()` functions. Run two code chunks below to get at a sample of the data and also preview all the column names:

```{r}
head(hotel_bookings)
```

```{r}
colnames(hotel_bookings)
```

## Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' and 'tidyverse' packages (optional)

If you haven't already installed and loaded the `ggplot2` package, you will need to do that before you can use the `ggplot()` function. You only have to do this once though, not every time you call `ggplot()`.

You can also skip this step if you haven't closed your RStudio account since doing the last activity. If you aren't sure, you can run the code chunk and hit 'cancel' if the warning message pops up telling you that you have already downloaded the `ggplot2` package.

Run the code chunk below to install and load `ggplot2`. This may take a few minutes!

```{r}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
```

If you haven't installed and loaded `tidyverse` in this RStudio session, you can run the code chunk below. This may take a few minutes!

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

## Step 4: Annotating your chart

Your stakeholder tells you that they would like you to create a visualization that compares market segments between city hotels and resort hotels. This will help inform how the company targets promotions in the future. They ask you to create a cleaned and labeled version and save it as a .png file so they can include it in a presentation.

As a refresher, here’s a chart similar to what you created in a previous activity:

```{r}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel)
```

This creates two bar graphs: one for 'city_hotel' data and one for 'resort_hotel' data. The x axis is 'market_segment' and the y axis is 'count' for both charts.

In this visualization, it is unclear where the data is from, what the main takeaway is, or even what the data is showing. To explain all of that, you can leverage annotations in `ggplot2`.

The first step will be adding a title; that is often the first thing people will pay attention to when they encounter a data visualization for the first time. To add a title, you will add `labs()` at the end of your `ggplot()` command and then input a title there. Add a descriptive title to the code chunk below:

```{r}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  labs(title="City hotels and resort hotels market segment comparison")
```

This code chunk will generate the same chart as before, but now it includes a title to explain the data visualization more clearly to your audience.

You also want to add another detail about what time period this data covers. To do this, you need to find out when the data is from.

You realize you can use the `min()` function on the year column in the data:

```{r}
min(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year)
```

And the `max()` function:

```{r}
max(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year)
```

But you will need to save them as variables in order to easily use them in your labeling; the following code chunk creates two of those variables:

```{r}
mindate <- min(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year)
maxdate <- max(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year)
```

Now, you will add in a subtitle using `subtitle=` in the `labs()` function. Then, you can use the `paste0()` function to use your newly-created variables in your labels. This is really handy, because if the data gets updated and there is more recent data added, you don't have to change the code below because the variables are dynamic:

```{r}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  labs(title="Comparison of market segments by hotel type for hotel bookings",
       subtitle=paste0("Data from: ", mindate, " to ", maxdate))
```

This code chunk will add the subtitle 'Data from: 2015 to 2017' underneath the title you added earlier to the chart.

You realize that this chart is displaying the technical details a little too prominently. You don't want that to be the second thing people notice during the presentation. You decide to switch the subtitle to a caption which will appear in the bottom right corner instead.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  labs(title="Comparison of market segments by hotel type for hotel bookings",
       caption=paste0("Data from: ", mindate, " to ", maxdate))
```

This code chunk makes a slight change to the visualization you created in the last chunk; now the "data from: 2015 to 2017" subtitle is in the bottom right corner.

Now you want to clean up the x and y axis labels to make sure they are really clear. To do that, you can add to the `labs()` function and use `x=` and `y=`. Feel free to change the text of the label and play around with it:

```{r}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  labs(title="Comparison of market segments by hotel type for hotel bookings",
       caption=paste0("Data from: ", mindate, " to ", maxdate),
       x="Market Segment",
       y="Number of Bookings")
```

## Step 5: Saving your chart


Now, it's time to save what you just created so you can easily share with stakeholders.

You can use the `ggsave()` function to do just that! It will save your image as a 7x7 at the file path you input by default, which makes it simple to export your plots from R.

The `ggsave()` function in the code chunk below will save the last plot that was generated, so if you ran something after running the code chunk above, run that code chunk again.

Then run the following code chunk to save that plot as a .png file named `hotel_booking_chart`, which makes it clear to your stakeholders what the .png file contains. Now you should be able to find this file in your 'Files' tab in the bottom right of your screen. Check it out!

```{r}
ggsave('hotel_booking_chart.png', width=7, height=7)
```

### hotel_booking_chart.png

If you wanted to make your chart bigger and more rectangular to fit the slideshow presentation, you could specify the height and width of your .png in the `ggsave()` command. Edit the code chunk below to create a 16x8 .png image:

```{r}
ggsave('hotel_booking_chart1.png', width=16, height=8)
```

### hotel_booking_chart1.png

## Activity Wrap Up

Now you have finished creating and exporting a data visualization with annotations in `ggplot2`, you can share what you created with key stakeholders to give them insights into your data findings. These skills will allow you to create, annotate, and share your data visualizations directly from your R console space. You will continue learning more about `ggplot2` functions in this course, but with the skills you have already been practicing, you will be able to generate plots, utilize aesthetic functions, apply filters, and create annotations to explain your data.

When you complete this activity, save it by clicking the File tab in the upper left of the RStudio console and then selecting Save. You will use this document (or any other R activity you have completed and saved in this course) for an upcoming activity.
